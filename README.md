# CFGDegreeData2_CarbonIntensityAssignment
CFGDegree Assignment 2: Using Python to call APIs and manipulate the data meaningfully.

## Carbon Intensity API
Using the Carbon Intensity API provided by National Grid ESO, in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe, University of Oxford Department of Computer Science and WWF.<br>
This API provides the Carbon Intensity from a user-specified period of time for each region in Great Britain. <br>

Data used from: <br>
Distribution Network Areas: Energy Solutions: Understanding PES Distributor Areas: <br>https://www.energybrokers.co.uk/electricity/PES-Distributor-areas <br> <br>
Carbon Intensity: <br>https://carbonintensity.org.uk/



## Code Output
The user inputs a town of their choice, which is used to find the associated region and its carbon intensity across the period of a chosen day.
