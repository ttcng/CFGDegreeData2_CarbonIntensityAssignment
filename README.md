# CFGDegreeData2_CarbonIntensityAssignment
CFGDegree Assignment 2: Using Python to call APIs and manipulate the data meaningfully.

## Carbon Intensity API
Data used from:
Distribution Network Areas: Energy Solutions: Understanding PES Distributor Areas: https://www.energybrokers.co.uk/electricity/PES-Distributor-areas
Carbon Intensity: https://carbonintensity.org.uk/

Using the Carbon Intensity API provided by National Grid ESO, in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe, University of Oxford Department of Computer Science and WWF.

This API provides the history for each region in Great Britain. 

## Code Output
The user inputs a town of their choice, which is used to find the associated region and its carbon intensity across the period of a chosen day.
